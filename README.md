# Stereo_balancer
A simple project for balancing stereo audio for headphone users on windows


# What does this project do?
This project is an initial attempt to solve the issue of unbalanced stereo in modern windows. I.e when you're watching a youtube video and you only have audio coming out of the left ear of your headphones. I find this particularly annoying and found myself thinking "why has technology not fixed this yet?", so I decided to take a crack at it.
